//Part 1: 
//1. The difference between interpolation and concatenation is that concatenation 
//adds strings together and interpolation is a template that strings new stuff together.

//2. DRY stand for "Don't repeat yourself". We should pay attention to it because it makes 
//our code cleaner and helps so we don't have broken codes as well as saves time. While 
//loops and regular loops help us with dry code.

//3. The difference between declaring a variable and assigning a value to a variable is that 
//declaring a variable means that memory is put for the variable and assigning a value to a 
//variable is when a value is assigned to the variable. The value in a variable can change so
//defining the variable means what the value is at the end of an operation.

//4. Const is when you want to be strict about not duplicating variables that are exactly 
//the same. Let allows you to redefine a variable.

//5. A parent directory is the directory in which the folder or current directory
//you are working on (or thinking of) lives in. 

//6. One way to find out what a command does in Unix is to type "man" and then the command
//that you want to know.

//7. Tab completion makes typing a lot faster! It saves time as well as helps with typo's.
